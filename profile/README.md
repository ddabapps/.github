# DelphiDabbler Applications

This organisation will eventually contain several applications currently hosted on https://github.com/delphidabbler

At present there are just the following placeholder repos that have been created because of an idea I had, but which may go away without notice:

* [rpt](https://github.com/ddabapps/rpt) - An idea for a template replacement program based on a cut down version of Liquid. Maybe one day!
* [midiview](https://github.com/ddabapps/midiview) - Was intended to be able to describe MIDI information. Doubtful this will see the light of day.
* [maths-n-music](https://github.com/ddabapps/maths-n-music) - An application to generate music from mathematical sequences. Needs more research into the generation algorithms. I'd like to do this one, but not promising!

More real projects will be transferred here eventually.
