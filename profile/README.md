## Projects not started

The following repos have not yet had any work done on them. They have been created because of an idea I had. ‚ö†Ô∏è These repos may be deleted without notice.

| Project | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| [`rpt`](https://github.com/ddabapps/rpt) | An idea for a template replacement program based on a cut down version of Liquid. There are copious notes in the project's [wiki](https://github.com/ddabapps/rpt/wiki). Maybe one day! |
| [`midiview`](https://github.com/ddabapps/midiview) | Was intended to be able to describe MIDI information. Doubtful this will see the light of day. |
| [`maths-n-music`](https://github.com/ddabapps/maths-n-music) | An application to generate music from mathematical sequences. Needs more research into the generation algorithms. I'd like to do this one, but not promising anything! |
